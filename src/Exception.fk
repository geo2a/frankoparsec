data Maybe A = just A | nothing 

sig Exception E
  = throw E [] X

note 
  catch [Exception E ? X] [] Either E X
  catch [x]            = right x  
  catch [throw e ? k]  = left e

note
catch' [Exception E ? X] [] Maybe X
catch' [x]            = just x
catch' [throw e ? k]  = nothing

note Usage example, needs Nat.fk

  ex [Exception Char] Char
  ex = 'a' >> throw 'b'

  note
  main [] Maybe Char
  main = catch' ? ex!

  main [] Either Char Nat
  main = left 'a'
