Experimental parsers combinators library implemented with Frank programming language, based on [frankjnr](https://github.com/cmcl/frankjnr) implementation. 

## Running something 

As far as Frank doesn't have module system of any kind, you may ask your `cat` to grab some files and concatenate them for you.   

```
cat Control.fk Either.fk Exception.fk List.fk State.fk Nat.fk Parser.fk | frank
```
