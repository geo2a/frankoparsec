Experimental parsers combinators library implemented with Frank programming language, based on [frankjnr](https://github.com/cmcl/frankjnr) implementation. 

## Running something 

As far as Frank doesn't have module system of any kind, you may ask your `cat` to grab some files and concatenate them for you.   

Add some code to `src/Main.fk` and execute `run-main.sh`. You can modify command in `run-main.sh` to add more modules.

## Tests

Some tests are available in `tests/Tests.fk`, execute `run-tests.sh` to run them.
